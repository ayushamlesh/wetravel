  <div class="parallax"></div>
  <div style="margin:50px; font-family:'Lucida Sans Unicode', 'Lucida Grande', sans-serif;">
    <p id="p">The culture of India refers collectively to the thousands of distinct and unique cultures of all religions and communities present in India. India's languages, religions, dance, music, architecture, food and customs differ from place to place within the country. Indian culture, often labeled as an amalgamation of several cultures, spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced by a history that is several millennia old. Many elements of India's diverse cultures, such as Indian religions, philosophy, cuisine, languages, dance, music and movies have a profound impact across the Indosphere, Greater India and the world.</p>

    <p id="p">
      India has 28 states with different culture and the second most populated country in the world. The Indian culture, spans across the Indian subcontinent and has been influenced and shaped by a history that is several thousand years old. Throughout the history of India, Indian culture has been heavily influenced by Dharmic religions. They have been credited with shaping much of Indian philosophy, literature, architecture, art and music. Greater India was the historical extent of Indian culture beyond the Indian subcontinent. This particularly concerns the spread of Hinduism, Buddhism, architecture, administration and writing system from India to other parts of Asia through the Silk Road by the travelers and maritime traders during the early centuries of the Common Era. To the west, Greater India overlaps with Greater Persia in the Hindu Kush and Pamir Mountains. Over the centuries, there has been a significant fusion of cultures between Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, Jains, Sikhs and various tribal populations in India</p>

    <p>Indian cuisine consists of a variety of regional and traditional cuisines native to the Indian subcontinent.
       Given the diversity in soil, climate, culture, ethnic groups, and occupations, 
       these cuisines vary substantially and use locally available spices, herbs, vegetables,
      and fruits. Indian food is also heavily influenced by religion,
      in particular Hinduism, cultural choices and traditions.
      The cuisine is also influenced by centuries of Islamic rule,
       particularly the Mughal rule. Samosas and pilafs are examples.</p>

    <p>Historical events such as invasions, trade relations, and colonialism have played
       a role in introducing certain foods to this country. The Columbian discovery of the
        New World brought a number of new vegetables and fruit to India.
         A number of these such as the potato, tomatoes, chillies, peanuts,
          and Guava have become staples in many regions of India. Indian cuisine 
          has shaped the history of international relations; the spice trade between 
          India and Europe was the primary catalyst for Europe's Age of Discovery. 
          Spices were bought from India and traded around Europe and Asia. Indian cuisine 
          has influenced other cuisines across the world, especially those from Europe 
          (especially Britain), the Middle East, Southern African, East Africa,
           Southeast Asia, North America, Mauritius, Fiji, Oceania, and the Caribbean.</p>
